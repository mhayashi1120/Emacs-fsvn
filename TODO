* General
** annoying fsvn-result buffer.

** `merge' can use ediff-merge

** fsvn-xml-*-dtd-alist check original dtd.

** what is scheduled commit? `status' forth column.

** mode-line and easymenu

** some help mode (command brief description)

** file-select, message-edit can kill-buffer when commiting.

** Bugreport

** about SVN_SSH
** TODO Activate only magic name.

** font-lock not works fine in some cases.
consider `font-lock-fontify' call or not

buffer name start with ` ' (space)

** tool-bar

** to configure ex: C-c C-u

** search log diff and message

** describe doc about process-list 
enable send password
freezing processes.

** complete args fsvn-browse-* interactive

inhibit path completion.

* magic
** `fsvn-magic-directory-files' accept svn:externals


* browse-mode
** Draw symbolic link like dired buffer.
** Enable Move file (in repository)

** move case wrong file by svn `move'

fsvn-browse.*move-in-repository

** in repository C-x C-f or something bound to open by url function

** fsvn-browse-svn:externals-selected

from other repository

** rename multiple file that have same filename

SomeFile.Designer.cs -> AnyFile.Designer.cs
SomeFile.cs          -> AnyFile.cs


** fsvn-select/ fsvn-msgedit generate-buffer function

generate to get change buffer name to commit target filename?


* select-file-mode
** symbolic link

** TODO when commit file-select buffer has svn:external file.
** Instant viewer that for modified file or changed directory hierarchy.
  currently `*' mark is display commited files, not manupulated file.

** enable resolved

* message-edit-mode
** parasite-*-execute command accept optional argument

* completion
** fsvn-completing-url to parse previous segment
** fsvn-completing-read-url behavior different general Emacs one.
** completing read implementation cleaning.
** fsvn-file-select hide/show non selected files.


* General (refactor)
** fsvn-command-args-canonicalize move to more critical point.
** fsvn-url-encode-string more critical point.
** case sensitive when windows filesystem only. (ex: fsvn-url-belongings-p)
** fsvn-magic-* inspect how to implements.

** fsvn-prop* code clean.


* logview-mode
** fsvn-log-message-buffer-name, fsvn-log-sibling-buffer-name contains first space then fontify is not work.

** tortoise like log cache.

cache log xml file to ~/.fsvn/cache/logs/{md5}
each file contains one revision
revision range and log base url

** fsvn-log-list-mode gui viewer.
 call tortoise viewer (Windows)
** logview-mode diff with non visible revision.


** log-sibling return to specific revision file. (use magic file name)
** patch
property is changed created patch wrong??

* prop-mode

** prop-recursive-mode

proplist --recursive

** propedit and not changed value but want to apply recursively

* diff
** ediff directory
** diff directory
** diff binary file invoke filter program. (Like OpenOffice file)


* Other
** improve UI about read arguments (ex --targets like argument not necessary in completion)

** TODO dired-mode remove vc-find-file-hook from find-file-hook

** fsvn-blame-minor-mode more efficient UI

** fsvn-blame-minor-mode accept revision range


** parse result threshold

** tsvn:lockmsgminsize, tsvn:logsummary, tsvn:projectlanguage

   http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_ja/tsvn-dug-propertypage.html




** git


*** like `git stash'


stash id is stash date {yyyyMMddHHmmss}

md5 is directory by directory-file-name.

~/.fsvn/stash/{md5 of directory name}/{yyyyMMddHHmmss}

* svk

** Not familiar interface

** depotmap --init

not works on windows


* popup-result-mode

** `update' `merge' output 

Currently buffer's point is not move from (point-min)
Sometime prompt stop process, so cannot notice the prompt without scrolling.
move to point-max? only update or merge (switch?)

** all interactive command must be accept argument (ex filename, command arguments)
  this is test for that command.
** annoying fsvn-result buffer.

** support `merge'
 can use ediff-merge

** fsvn-xml-*-dtd-alist check original dtd.

** what is scheduled commit? `status' forth column.

** mode-line and easymenu

** some help mode (command brief description)

** License GPL V2 -> GPL v3

** file-select, message-edit can kill-buffer when commiting.

** complete revision with electric select

* magic
** `fsvn-magic-directory-files' accept svn:externals


* browse-mode
** Draw symbolic link like dired buffer.
** Enable Move file (in repository)

** show current directory status top of the buffer.
** move case wrong file by svn `move'

* select-file-mode
** symbolic link

** TODO when commit file-select buffer has svn:external file.
** Instant viewer that for modified file or changed directory hierarchy.
  currently `*' mark is display commited files, not manupulated file.

* message-edit-mode
** parasite-*-execute command accept optional argument

* completion
** fsvn-read-subcommand-args accept quoted string
  space containing filename to quoted string.

** fsvn-completing-url to parse previous segment
** fsvn-completing-read-url behavior different general Emacs one.
** completing read implementation cleaning.
** fsvn-file-select hide/show non selected files.


* General (refactor)
** fsvn-flatten-command-args move to more critical point.
** fsvn-url-encode-string more critical point.
** case sensitive when windows filesystem only. (ex: fsvn-url-belongings-p)
** fsvn-svn-command -> fsvn-initialize-loading create fsvn-svn-command-internal

** fsvn-magic-* inspect how to implements.

** fsvn-prop* code clean.


* logview-mode
** fsvn-log-message-buffer-name, fsvn-log-sibling-buffer-name contains first space then fontify is not work.

** tortoise like log cache.

** fsvn-log-list-mode gui viewer.
 call tortoise viewer (Windows)
** logview-mode diff with non visible revision.

** this file arg to interactive arg

** refactor about diff

* prop-mode

** prop-recursive-mode

proplist --recursive

* diff
** async diff
** ediff directory
** diff directory
** diff binary file throw filter program.(Like OpenOffice file)


* Other
** improve UI about read arguments (ex --targets like argument not necessary in completion)

** TODO dired-mode remove vc-find-file-hook from find-file-hook

** fsvn-blame-minor-mode more efficient UI

** parse result threshold

** tsvn:lockmsgminsize, tsvn:logsummary, tsvn:projectlanguage

* svk

** Not familiar interface

** depotmap --init

not works on windows


* popup-result-mode

** `update' `merge' output 

Currently buffer's point is not move from (point-min)
Sometime prompt stop process, so cannot notice the prompt without scrolling.
move to point-max? only update or merge (switch?)

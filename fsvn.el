;;; Commentary:

;; fsvn supports
;;  * GNU Emacs 23.x or later.
;;  * Subversion 1.5.x or later. (1.4.x works but some restrictions)

;; fsvn has TortoiseSVN like user interface by using `svn' command.
;;  Have following advantages of other Emacs svn client.
;;  * tsvn:*, bugtraq:* like property supported. (or will be supported)
;;  * Using `svn help' output for completing read.
;;  * Fast in huge working copy by background process.
;;  * Has repository browser.
;;  * Has visualize blame/annotate/praise minor-mode.
;;  * Has svk support

;;  But following **disadvantage** has.
;;  * Key bindings are not familiar for legacy user.
;;  * Dired like interface but not exactly equals dired functions.
;;  * A little user help.

;; This package is tested on following environment.
;;      NTEmacs (based Emacs 23.1) on Windows.  svn 1.5.x - 1.7.x
;;      Emacs (23.2) on GNU/Linux (Debian).  svn svn 1.5.x - 1.7.x
;;      Emacs current (24.0.50) on GNU/Linux (Debian).  svn 1.5.x - 1.7.x

;;; Code:



(defgroup fsvn nil
  "Emacs subversion interface."
  :group 'tools
  :prefix "fsvn-")

(defconst fsvn-version "0.9.11"
  "Version of fsvn.")



;;; Configuration in dot-emacs

;; 1. Add svn command path to `exec-path' correctly.
;;    Otherwise set `fsvn-svn-command' `fsvn-svnadmin-command' value by full-path before loading/requiring.
;; 
;; (setq fsvn-svn-command "/path/to/svn.exe"
;;       fsvn-svnadmin-command "/path/to/svnadmin.exe")

;; 2. global key bindings (option)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xv!" 'fsvn-command)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xv," 'fsvn-backward-popup-result-buffer)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xv." 'fsvn-forward-popup-result-buffer)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvV" 'fsvn-vc-commit)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvG" 'fsvn-blame-minor-mode)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvI" 'fsvn-import)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvL" 'fsvn-vc-print-log)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvO" 'fsvn-checkout)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvP" 'fsvn-process-list)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvZ" 'fsvn-debug-toggle)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xv\ec" 'fsvn-global-cleanup-buffer)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvN" 'fsvn-vc-commit-non-query)
